### Project1: CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION(OVERVIEW)

This is a classification problem in which we aim to predict if a transaction is fraudulent. The dataset comprised 31 columns and 284807 records. The imbalanced nature of the dataset was fixed using a technique called oversampling.  Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Selection, and Feature Scaling were performed, and important features were chosen to make the data ready for model building.
Below is the summary of the performance of each of the machine learning models:
Logistic Regression(accuracy-97% and recall- 94%).
Naive Bayes(accuracy-98 and recall-92%)
Decision Tree(accuracy-99% and recall-85%)
Hard-Voting-Classififer(accuracy-99% and recall-84%)
Soft-Voting-Classifier(accuracy-100% and recall-85%
